    "##### Clocks in Sox is a small company that manufactures wristwatches in two separate workshops, each with a single watch maker (or horologist, as they are called). Each watchmaker works a different number of hours per month to make the three models sold by Clocks in Sox: Model A, Model B, and Model C. Watchmaker 1 works a maximum of 350 hours per month while Watchmaker 2 works a maximum of 250 hours per month and the time (in hours) and cost of materials for each watch differ by watchmaker due to their experience and equipment (shown below). Each month, Clocks in Sox must produce at least 60 Model A watches, 80 Model B watches, and 50 Model C watches. Clearly formulate a linear program (LP) to minimize the cost of manufacturing the desired amount of watches.\n",
