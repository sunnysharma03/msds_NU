So he can purchase 100 feet of fencing for \\\\$10, 64 feet for \\\\$8, etc. He must also purchase fence posts to reinforce the fencing, and due to wind conditions in his yard, he must purchase more posts for east-west fencing than north-south fencing.

    "#### 5. A local farmer’s market sells, among other things, fresh apples during the harvest season. The market has \\\\$750 to purchase bushels of apples from orchard 1 at \\\\$5 per bushel, orchard 2 at \\\\$6 per bushel, or orchard 3 at \\\\$8 per bushel. However, the quality of the apples varies by orchard and the market can earn (in profit) \\\\$10 per bushel from orchard 1, \\\\$11 per bushel from orchard 2, and \\\\$20 per bushel from orchard 3. Orchard 3 is selective with its sales and will only sell between 20 and 40 bushels to the market. That is, it will not sell to the farmer’s market if they order fewer than 20 bushels and will not sell more than 40 bushels to the market. Further, orchard 1 only has 50 bushels available to sell."
