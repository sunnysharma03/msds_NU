    <description>Coffee-Shop

A coffee shop presents a simple queueing problem for introducing discrete event simulation.  The program has events corresponding customer arrivals, joining a queue or balking, entering and receiving/ending service. An event log is produced showing customer/caseid, time, and activity. Analyses of the event log are perforned at the end of the script. Refer to the console output to see results.</description>
