Starring Robert Pattinson as DC's Caped Crusader, 2022's new movie The Batman is an intense, apocalyptic cinematic experience. Following the famous murder of Bruce Waynes parents, Wayne is two years into his crusade against Gotham City street crime. As Batman unpicks the cryptic clues, the investigation peels away a greater conspiracy. But the real riddle is how the ranting killer's twisted motive ties back to Batman himself. He Batman (in theaters March 4) is barely a superhero movie, Christopher Nolan's criminal politics and Zack Snyder's operatic brutality, plus the standalone Joker movie's psychological backstory, vaguely timeless design and layers of dark irony. Most of all, The Batman is a straight up horror film. This new flick is PG-13, but it's on a whole other level from the relatively bloodless Dark Knight movies -- and on a different planet from any Marvel film -- immersing you in a nerve-shredding three hours of escalating dread and simmering pain garnished with some astonishingly nasty, and dark touches, and makes think what one man can go through because of loosing his parents. You absolutely 100% can't show The Batman to a child, it will give them nightmares, and bad thoughts. Robert Pattinson's batman is lank-haired mess, and is a world away from Christian Bales outstanding professional look. This darkest Dark Knight may not be for everyone (and certainly not kids), but it's a gripping and nerve-shredding Bat-thriller. The one thing that Matt Reeves explores that Christopher Nolan doesn't is how dark and how can he make it to the story, and comic, and even a horror movie. The Batman should have been rated R not PG-13 because how intense, Dark and scary it is. The soundtrack was done by Michael Giacchino, its very graceful incorporation of specific themes for Batman and Selina, as well as pre-existing music ranging from classical pieces to Nirvana, provides tonal variation to ensure that The Batman never becomes a punishing downer. Go watch The Batman on March 4, 2022 at your Regal theater.",10
The Batman,oworsley-61120,IMDB,6/3/22,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7923069/?ref_=tturv_perm_9,"Detective, Batman, Pattinson, gordon, realistic",114,"Some cool action scenes but doesn't deliver on the detective side of Batman. The dialogue was also really bad. Most people either yelled or tried talking in these silly deep voices, and in this case it wasn't Batman. It was the chiefs of police and Gordon. They just didn't work. Zoe Kravitz was good as cat woman. Pattinson was actually good as Batman, but not a good Bruce Wayne. Alfred was pointless. The script over all just wasn't that good. The cinematography could have been better too. They tried to be different with their realistic camera angles but mostly they failed. It missed the marked. And lastly it was too long and too slow.",4
The Batman,Blanbrn,IMDB,5/3/22,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7920842/?ref_=tturv_perm_10,"Batman, secrets, Gotham, underworld, serial",296,"Always been a ""Batman"" fan as the D. C. legend is my favorite superhero and watching all of the movies from the classic 1989 one, every so often the fans see that the series changes tone and feel as it's rebooted. ""The Batman"" directed by Matt Reeves is a dark take with conflict as ""Batman"" deals with a city underworld of secrets, while serial killings are happening, and the hope and chance for romance struts right in front of him.

Gotham has a serial killer on the loose and with each victim found strange puzzle like word clues are left, as ""Batman"" investigates the mystery and things become complex as it's all tied into a world of city officials and underworld crime figures are connected to them. Plus secrets come up as ""Batman"" himself is wrapped up into this wicked game.

The film chemistry and cast of characters are top notch with young star Robert Pattinson filling out the bat suit just fine and Zoe Kravitz is raw and outspoken as Selina Kyle a slash friend and foe love interest of the bat. Colin Farrell was well made up as the Penguin thru it all combined with fire blazing action and kick butt punches ""The Batman"" is a compelling drama with suspense and revealing secrets of Gotham city officials as crime boss Carmine Falcone is a lead figure to all of this.

""The Batman"" is in depth and dark a new reboot style take on the D. C legend as it's a good film still not the best, still if a ""Batman"" and D. C. fan you will enjoy as the film rubs off a feel from many of the graphic novels, as to get more understanding read ""The Dark Knight Returns"" or ""The Long Halloween"".",8
The Batman,Allierubystein666,IMDB,4/3/2022,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7917308/?ref_=tturv_perm_23,"Batman, superhero, everything, movie, villain",361,"Yes, it may be the billionth Batman film in recent memory- but The Batman is easily among the best, if not the best, Batman films ever made. Everything works in this movie, and I mean everything. From the cinematography, to the visuals, set direction, score, acting, direction, writing- it never fails, and it never lets up. There are a few tiny predictable things here and there, but none really take an impact on the quality of the movie, nor the story its telling. It is 3 hours long, but the runtime passes fast, and honestly I never wanted it to end. Robert pattinson is just fantastic in this film, a Batman for the ages, and honestly my favorite film adaptation of the character yet. The rest of the supporting cast is also excellent, Jeffrey Wright bringing a new layer onto the character of Commissioner Gordon, as well as zoe Kravitz with her excellent portrayal of Selena Kyle (aka Catwoman). It's Paul Dano's Riddler that really takes the film by storm however, easily delivering the best villain performance in a superhero film in recent memory, whose zodiac style roots really intensify a new look to the iconic character. Colin Farrell is also excellent as the Penguin in the film, and I hope we get to see more use out of him in the future. Perhaps the most signature thing about this film is the look, a bleak and gritty look into Gotham's underworld, that really does- as director Matt Reeves said- push the limits of a PG-13 film. The look of the film is just outstanding and its hauntingly beautiful solemn poignancy is just wonderful to watch on screen- everything a true Batman fan would ever want. Not to mention the action and fight scenes throughout this film are just brilliant, easily breaking new ground, and capitalizing on its darker tone. In the end, I don't have enough words to say how much I loved The Batman. Again and again one word comes to be to describe it, extraordinary. It may seem familiar, but it's unlike anything you've seen before, and in the days of superhero movies- that's something really freaking rare.",10
The Batman,bdunnit,IMDB,13/3/2022,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7908723/?ref_=tturv_perm_37,"Batman, mumble, villains, Emo, Riddler",97,"I really don't understand all the love for this new Batman movie. It was very long and boring. It was filmed with no light. You can barely see anything. Ever character is speaking just above a whisper or mumble. The story was weak. The villains were not interesting. There were a couple of stupid scenes in the movie too. Emo Batman was not cool. I know Pattinson can act, but the script and direction let him down here. Riddler and Penguin were wasted here too. Bottomline, this movie is way over rated. Save your time and money.",3
The Batman,muradmontasir,IMDB,7/3/22,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7926348/?ref_=tturv_perm_14,"Batman, Gotham, vengeance, dark, movie",222,"I'm a huge Batman fan. The reviews and the scores given to this movie made me so excited to see it. I honestly was extremely disappointed. Without spoiling anything, I think this movie was excessively dark and slow just for the sake of it. I get it that the Batman operates in the night, and he's vengeance. But like a lot of scenes are super slow and just in the plain dark to give you that noir feel. I mean I get it, but to what end? It doesn't help the story, and it doesn't make you feel you're a part of the world, since they don't really develop anything, or even give us an understanding of the locations in Gotham. Its mostly either in the police station or a nightclub. Also, what does Batman add to the story? Catwoman does much better work and appears to have more initiative than Batman in this movie. The Riddler is a joke, and is not menacing at all. The only redeemable villain is Penguin, and we don't get enough of him in the movie. Penguin, Gordon and Catwoman. That's it the rest of the cast is so out of place. I think we've been spoiled by the Nolan trilogy, and I don't think this movie even compares to one single movie of this trilogy.",1
The Batman,giojuice,IMDB,1/3/2022,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7911186/?ref_=tturv_perm_17,"Batman, Zoe, Cinematography, Gotham, movie",140,"The Batman is a absolute amazing film from director (Matt reeves) with the beautiful cinematography and shots of Gotham. And the cast is spectacular with performances from (Robert Pattinson) Zoe Kravitz) (Jeffrey Wright) ( Colin Farrell) ( John Turturro) and the mvp!! (Paul Dano) this movie is gritty and grounded take on the dark knight like you never seen before and is definitely the scariest Batman yet!

Each member of the cast gets there time in the light.

And the action is definitely the best You will ever see in a Batman movie! It was a detective noir film that i was waiting for from Batman and made it feel like the Arkham games and comic books brought to life. This Batman film deserves to be right up there with the dark knight. And is another comic book film for the age's.",10

There is so much to dislike about ""The Bayman"" I am not sure where to begin. I'm a big noir fan, but this is 3 hours blacked out nonsense. Actors and action sequences are unrecognizable. And worse, Adam West is no longer the worst Batman. There are at least 10 scenes on the film that are too long, like the editor quit in post. This should have been a 2 hour movie. Thank God for Zoe Kravitz, John Turturro and Jeffrey Wright--all admirable. Attrociously disappointing.",3

This movie really won't be for everyone!! Easily the darkest Batman movie yet. It is gritty, depressing and not a fun movie at all.

This isn't your usual comic book movie, it's a detective movie, with more in common with Se7en, than previous Batman movies. The first two thirds of the movie are amazing, at one point I turned to my son and said ""This is a masterpiece"" everything works and is brilliant, I was 100% enthralled, but boy does it drop the ball in the final act.

Of the cast Pattinson is great, Collin Farrell is ok, Zoe Kravitz was fine too, but she has zero chemistry with Pattinson (Keaton and Pfeiffer they are not), Paul Dano though, was incredible, especially in the scene in Arkham, whilst Geoffrey Wright is as great as he always is.

On the downside, It does have some pacing issues, and is really too long (though I'm not sure what I'd cut), and I really wasn't keen on the ending (I don't know if it is a comic book storyline they did), as I think the final act really lets the movie down!! It's here, in the final act, that you feel the movies run time!!

I was surprised there were only 36 other people in my screening.",8

Definitely the most comic accurate Batman, and the grounded realism of this film made it ten times better to watch. We really need more of these dark and gritty movies from DC, this is what they're good at. Gotta hand it to Matt Reeves, this was an absolute masterpiece. Robert Pattinson and Paul Dano delivered excellent performances as the Batman and the Riddler, best performance by a comic book villain since Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight.",10
