The Batman,vespalavis,IMDB,1/3/22,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7908261/?ref_=tturv_perm_7,"Bruce violence, action, dark, one last thing",130,"It was so good! The beginning, the narration, Bruce's voice, his accent, Gotham City, music and sounds... it felt like I'm reading the comic and the pages come alive in my head! It was great! And I live violence, action, crime... this movie has everything! Beautiful car scenes to strong fight scenes to memorable and emotional and dark scenes to those detective scenes... I can't find the right words. You have to watch it.

I was told it's about 3 hours but didn't feel like it. I could easily go on for another hour or more.

And one last thing, make sure to watch it on a big screen because it's very dark and detailed, a movie theatre would be the best place to feel the movie as a whole!",10
The Batman,oworsley-61120,IMDB,6/3/22,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7923069/?ref_=tturv_perm_9,"Detective, Batman, Pattinson, gordon, realistic",114,"Some cool action scenes but doesn't deliver on the detective side of Batman. The dialogue was also really bad. Most people either yelled or tried talking in these silly deep voices, and in this case it wasn't Batman. It was the chiefs of police and Gordon. They just didn't work. Zoe Kravitz was good as cat woman. Pattinson was actually good as Batman, but not a good Bruce Wayne. Alfred was pointless. The script over all just wasn't that good. The cinematography could have been better too. They tried to be different with their realistic camera angles but mostly they failed. It missed the marked. And lastly it was too long and too slow.",4
The Batman,kdaglaroglou-657-16678,IMDB,1/5/22,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8108067/?ref_=tturv_perm_19,"Batman, burning, dark, spectacles, punchline",131,"When people review The Batman and find it long and depressing, I know that cinema is dying. The fast and easy generation cannot sit down and watch a slow burning, dark movie with an above average scenario that challenges (not much) their mind. They prefer light, colorful spectacles with a few laughs here and there, punchline dialogues and many, many explosions. Thank God there are still dark AAA movies. The rest of the audience, please wait for ""Love and Thunder"", while sending ""Sweet child o' mine "" to the top ten.

Now, for the movie. The movie is dark, and depressing, just like Batman. Of course there are plenty of weak spots, but they do not affect the big picture. For me it's the best Batman movie ever, miles ahead of Nolan's.",8
The Batman,diegosergioerasmus,IMDB,1/3/22,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7908170/?ref_=tturv_perm_16,"Thriller, Gotham, riddler, movie, love",123,"First of all the cast is amazing everyone thought why Robert and now all of them see why he's a great actor The movie is scary like a thriller I love it And it's so dark and creepy how Gotham is supposed to be!! Gotham is a sick place and was portrayed perfectly People say the movie is too long but I think it's perfect because then I get to enjoy the movie even more.

And let's not forget the riddler he's riddles, he's costume and he's voice are so scary I love it I'd go as far as to say that this might just be the best movie of 2022 and if you don't enjoy it there is something wrong with you!",10
The Batman,bdunnit,IMDB,13/3/2022,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7952587/?ref_=tturv_perm_16,"Batman, mumble, villains, Emo, Riddler",97,"I really don't understand all the love for this new Batman movie. It was very long and boring. It was filmed with no light. You can barely see anything. Ever character is speaking just above a whisper or mumble. The story was weak. The villains were not interesting. There were a couple of stupid scenes in the movie too. Emo Batman was not cool. I know Pattinson can act, but the script and direction let him down here. Riddler and Penguin were wasted here too. Bottomline, this movie is way over rated. Save your time and money.",3
The Batman,muradmontasir,IMDB,7/3/22,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7926348/?ref_=tturv_perm_14,"Batman, Gotham, vengeance, dark, movie",222,"I'm a huge Batman fan. The reviews and the scores given to this movie made me so excited to see it. I honestly was extremely disappointed. Without spoiling anything, I think this movie was excessively dark and slow just for the sake of it. I get it that the Batman operates in the night, and he's vengeance. But like a lot of scenes are super slow and just in the plain dark to give you that noir feel. I mean I get it, but to what end? It doesn't help the story, and it doesn't make you feel you're a part of the world, since they don't really develop anything, or even give us an understanding of the locations in Gotham. Its mostly either in the police station or a nightclub. Also, what does Batman add to the story? Catwoman does much better work and appears to have more initiative than Batman in this movie. The Riddler is a joke, and is not menacing at all. The only redeemable villain is Penguin, and we don't get enough of him in the movie. Penguin, Gordon and Catwoman. That's it the rest of the cast is so out of place. I think we've been spoiled by the Nolan trilogy, and I don't think this movie even compares to one single movie of this trilogy.",1
The Batman,agentsofsword,IMDB,2/3/22,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7911186/?ref_=tturv_perm_17,"Riddler, movie, mystery, car chase, prison escape",130,"I just saw the movie and I don't even know where to begin...

It's not like any cbms like ever, the riddler was great especially the performance of Paul.

The funeral and the riddle scenes were AMAZING I really loved those parts. The mystery was done real great and the action sequences were perfect especially the car chase, prison escape and final battle.

The film is dark i really loved the tone it doesn't rush itself. This movie might have the best Catwoman yet her character was good even if she didn't have a big screentime... Robert is a great Batman I love that we get to see more of his detective side.

Beautiful score and cinematography the music was way too loud at times especially at that club scene.",10
The Batman,quadelb,IMDB,7/3/22,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7926300/?ref_=tturv_perm_21,"Noir, Adam West, Batman, Zoe Kravitz, John Turturro",86,"Wow! There is so much to dislike about ""The Bayman"" I am not sure where to begin. I'm a big noir fan, but this is 3 hours blacked out nonsense. Actors and action sequences are unrecognizable. And worse, Adam West is no longer the worst Batman. There are at least 10 scenes on the film that are too long, like the editor quit in post. This should have been a 2 hour movie. Thank God for Zoe Kravitz, John Turturro and Jeffrey Wright--all admirable. Attrociously disappointing.",3
The Batman,kakuraka,IMDB,22/4/2022,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8082544/?ref_=tturv_perm_26,"First time, second time, camera angles, movie, film",131,"Watched the movie twice. First time for general experience. Second time with friends for attention to detail. The movie is actually a bit slow. I tried to find the reason. In the end, I came to the conclusion that this is all because of the frankly bad musical accompaniment. I understand that Nirvana is cool. But listening to the same song for 3 hours is too much. If the film's soundtrack had been more varied, it would have made the film much more dynamic. Otherwise, everything is very good. I liked the story, the acting, the camera angles and the way it was filmed. It can be seen that the movie was trying to be serious like the Joker. But unfortunately that didn't happen. I really want to see a sequel.",8
The Batman,quanith-89625,IMDB,1/3/22,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7909290/?ref_=tturv_perm_22,"Dark Knight, Matt Reeves, book movie, Heath Ledger, book villain",99,"Can't say much since this is spoiler free, but that was hands down the greatest comic book movie of all time. Definitely the most comic accurate Batman, and the grounded realism of this film made it ten times better to watch. We really need more of these dark and gritty movies from DC, this is what they're good at. Gotta hand it to Matt Reeves, this was an absolute masterpiece. Robert Pattinson and Paul Dano delivered excellent performances as the Batman and the Riddler, best performance by a comic book villain since Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight.",10
